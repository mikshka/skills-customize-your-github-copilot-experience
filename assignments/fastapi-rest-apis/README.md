# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework. Students will build a small CRUD API, practice request/response handling, input validation with Pydantic models, and run the app using Uvicorn.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Core API Implementation

#### Description
Implement a small REST API service using FastAPI that supports creating, reading, updating and deleting simple resources (for example, "items"). Use Pydantic models for request validation and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

#### Requirements
Completed project should:

- Provide endpoints for the following actions:
  - GET /items — list all items
  - GET /items/{item_id} — get a single item by id
  - POST /items — create a new item
  - PUT /items/{item_id} — update an existing item
  - DELETE /items/{item_id} — delete an item
- Use Pydantic models for request bodies and response models.
- Validate input and return suitable HTTP status codes (201 for creation, 404 for not found, etc.).
- Implement in-memory storage (a Python dict) so the API is runnable without a database.
- Include clear docstrings and comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

### 🛠️ Optional Enhancements

Add one or more of the following for bonus credit:

- Add query parameters for filtering or pagination on `GET /items`.
- Persist data to a simple SQLite database using `sqlite3` or `SQLModel`/`SQLAlchemy`.
- Add basic automated tests for endpoints using `pytest` and `httpx` or `requests`.
- Add OpenAPI metadata (tags, summary, response descriptions) to improve autogenerated docs.

## Starter files

This assignment includes a starter FastAPI app: `starter-code.py` which demonstrates a minimal, working API. Use it as a base or replace it with your own implementation.

## How to run (local)

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies and run the app:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
uvicorn starter-code:app --reload --port 8000
```

3. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to view the interactive API docs.

## Submission

Place your final implementation files in this folder. In `README.md` describe any extra features implemented and include instructions how to run tests (if added).
